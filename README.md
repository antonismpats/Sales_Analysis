# Sales_Analysis
Sales Analysis from an Electronics Store brand across USA using Jupyter Notebook (I recommend it definitely for Data Analysis). The python script uses pandas and matplotlib to analyze and visualize sales data. It performs various tasks such as combining data from multiple CSV files, cleaning and preprocessing the data, generating insightful visualizations and answering to questions such as "Which was the best Sales Month?", "Which city had the highest number of sales?" and "At what time did the most sales occured?". 

## Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

### Monthly Sales Analysis:
The bar chart depicting total sales by month indicates that December has the highest sales, suggesting a potential correlation with the holiday season when consumer spending tends to increase.
### City-wise Sales Analysis:
The city-wise sales bar chart provides insights into the distribution of sales across different locations. Further investigation into the factors influencing these variations could uncover opportunities for targeted marketing or operational improvements.
### Time-based Sales Analysis:
The line chart showing the total number of sales per hour highlights peak sales hours during the day. This information can be valuable for optimizing staffing levels, targeted promotions, or adjusting inventory management based on the times of high demand.
### Product Analysis:
The bar chart displaying quantity ordered for each product identifies popular items. Understanding the top-performing products can help in inventory management, marketing strategies, and product bundling.
### Dual-Axis Plot for Quantity and Price:
The dual-axis plot combines information on quantity ordered and the average price of each product. Products with higher quantities sold can be evaluated against their pricing, assisting in pricing strategies and identifying potential pricing-related trends.

## Key observations:

### Seasonal Variation:
December stands out as the highest sales month, indicating a potential seasonal trend that could be further explored for targeted marketing or inventory planning during peak seasons.
### Geographical Impact:
The city-wise analysis reveals disparities in sales across different locations. Investigating the factors influencing these variations can inform localized marketing efforts or adjustments to distribution strategies.
### Time-of-Day Impact:
Understanding the peak sales hours helps optimize resource allocation, such as staffing levels and targeted promotions during specific timeframes.
### Product Performance:
Identification of top-performing products allows for strategic decision-making in terms of inventory management, marketing emphasis, and potential cross-selling opportunities.
